## Contract problems

The contract problems are principal-agent problems based on a model where an investor (principal) and a manager (agent) enter into a fixed-length contract where the investor pays the manager to manage a firm. The investor benefits from increasing firm value and pays the manager for his work. The catch is that the manager can appropriate some firm value for himself, reporting a different (lower) firm value to the investor. The problem is how the investor should make the payment contract to incentivize the manager not to appropriate too much.
